### Development Mode

    There are two servers - 'client' and 'server'.
    
    The 'client' server (create-react-app) is only useful during
    development (for live-reload, etc).
    
    Start them both from the server directory with 'npm run dev'.
    
### Production Mode

    There will only be one server.
    Before every deployment, inside the client folder, compile your
    react app to the 'build' folder with "npm run build"
